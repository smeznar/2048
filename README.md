# 2048
2048 is a game made by gabrielecirulli which can be found in [his repository](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048). More information about the game can be found on [its Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_(video_game)).

# AI
For a seminar assignment at my university I made this AI, which uses a method similar to Monte Carlo method to estimate the best move. The result varies depending on number of games played between each move, but for 100 games played between each move it wins in around 93% and reaches the tile 4096 around 23% of the time.
